# Rails Lite

## Phase 1: Server Setup
The behind-the-scenes of what happens when you run "rails server". We use Rack, a middleware between a web server and web application framework, to start up the webserver.

## Phase 2: Basic Controller
Set up ControllerBase which provides render and redirect_to controller methods.

## Phase 3: Template Rendering
Evaluate ERB code.

## Phase 4: Session Storing
Store session information and update controller with info.

## Phase 5: Routing and Params
Set up Routes that store URL pattern.
